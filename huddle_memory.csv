","Love that mindset because 100% something stable and fruitful does take time to build. In terms of how much it's helped me??? Invaluable bro like literally haven’t had this much personal growth or understanding of wealth creation before. Ive been able to start growing in all aspects of life bro not just financially. Haha no problem at all with asking man, the business systems we tap into revolves around the everyday commodities industry, so we take out people in a supply chain which frees up money and we get a rebate from, however how we leverage platforms is where it's best my mentors come in and explain to you like they did with me over 4-6 weeks of an education process.

I’ll catch up with them this coming Friday, if there’s any good news and I get the chance to drop your name to them I can let you know","Final Reply:

Hey bro, love your mindset! Building something stable and fruitful definitely takes time. I've had a lot of personal growth and gained a better understanding of wealth creation through this journey. Our business taps into the everyday commodities industry, streamlining the supply chain to free up money and earn rebates. If you're interested, my mentors could explain it much better during their 4-6 week education process.

I'm catching up with them this Friday. If there's any good news, I'll definitely drop your name and let you know. Let me know if you have any questions!",
